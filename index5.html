    <caption><strong>Bhavish Aggarwal</strong>-Co-Founder and CEO</caption><br>
    <blockquote>Bhavish is the Co-Founder & CEO of Ola, one of the world’s largest ride-sharing platforms and India’s most popular mobile app for transportation. With the mission of building mobility for a billion people, he started Ola (formerly OlaCabs) in 2010 with Ankit Bhati, a fellow alumnus from the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai, the country’s premier institution for technology and science.<br>

        Before Ola, Bhavish worked with Microsoft Research for two years, filing two patents alongside having three papers published in international academic journals. True to his belief of the need to have on-demand consumer transportation as a service, Bhavish doesn't own a car himself and vows that he never will!
